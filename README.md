Facial Sentiment Analysis from Scratch
Overview

Through this project, I have performed intense image classification on FER-2013 competition dataset using a custom model trained from scratch.
Key Features

    -->State-of-the-art Data Augmentation
        Used TensorFlow's ImageDataGenerator Module to perform meticulous data augmentation
        Decreased layers in each convolutional block to time-optimize the model

    -->Self trained Model
        Trained a model by referring to the VGG-Net research paper and significantly modified the architecture to meet demands of the current classification task
        Used a voting classifier for robust predictions.

Technologies and Skills
Key Skills:
